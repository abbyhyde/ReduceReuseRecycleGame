                Our game, when completed, will have a board where users roll a die and depending what space they land one, they play one of three minigames. Each minigame teaches players to either reduce, reuse, or recycle items commonly thrown in the trash. To advance
                on the board, players must achieve a passing score on each minigame. The goal is to make it to the end of the board after playing the minigames.
