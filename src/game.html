                Our game, when completed, will have a board where users roll a die and depending what space they land one, they play one of three minigames. Each minigame teaches players to either reduce, reuse, or recycle 
                items commonly thrown in the trash. To advance on the board, players must achieve a passing score on each minigame. The goal is to make it to the end of the board after playing the minigames.

            <h2> Minigames </h2>

            <p>
                Our board game will feature minigames such as DIY Doozy, Eco-friendly Hustle, and Trash or Treasure. DIY Doozy teaches players how to repurpose materials normally thrown away into
                 new items they can use. Eco-friendly Hustle teaches players lifestyle choices that help the environment 
                 such as composting. Trash or Treasure teaches players whether certain items are recyclable or not, such as batteries, and what the correct practices for disposing them are.
