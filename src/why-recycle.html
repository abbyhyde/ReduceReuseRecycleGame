	<h1>Why You Should Recycle</h1>
	<p>When it comes to recycling, every little bit counts. Landfills are already overflowing with trash, and many of the items simply thrown away can be recycled or repurposed into new items that can be used again.
	Our hope is that our game inspires others to recycle more in their own lives, as it's important to take care of our planet. Recycling can also be a first step to other environmentally-friendly practices such as
	composting and locally sourced food. According to the EPA, 23% of items discarded into landfills in 2018 was paper or paperboard, a material that can be easily recycled. In addition, 25.2% was metal, glass, or
	 plastics, more materials that can often be recycled instead. 

	Climate change is a big threat to humanityâ€™s existence. While more ownership for pollution needs to be put on corporations, every individual can also make a difference in the carbon dioxide content of our planet 
	by recycling. We hope you've been inspired to take action and recycle more in your life. Thank you.
